# 1.02 Activity 1

- Can you explain what is the case study?

The case study involves builiding a model that will maximize the revenue generated from people who haven't donated in a while (13-24 months).

- Brainstorm on the possible sets of goals (questions that will help the business) that can be achieved with the data - **Lean Brainstorming:** _Have every student write on a piece of paper as many goals can be achieved as they can think of in a minute. Then, have everybody show their piece of paper to the camera or paste them on the wall. Lastly, the instructor will go over some of the answers they can see, calling out coincidences, ridiculous ideas and other singularities that may appear._

  - What is the profile of the most generous donors? Where are they from? What is their income, etc.? Was their donation a one-off or repeated donations?
  - Were the people who donated the most generally repeat donors, one-off donors, or both?
  - How frequent were promotions to this type of donors? Was a lapse in promotion seen?
  - What's the most common timeframe since the last donation seen across lapsed donors? Was there an external event around that time that might've influenced donations?
  - How did donations from lapsed donors vary over time? How does that correlate with promotions?

- List the key objectives/goals

  - Find the most profitable donors within the lapsed donors

- What will be the steps that you would follow to conduct the analysis process?

  - Clean the data  
  - Transform it so that it can be easily used in graphs  
  - Run some exploratory data analysis to observe trends & patterns
